      <h1>Hello World</h1>

      <section>

        <h2>This is Me</h2>
        <p>I am an organised superpower who daily restrains the chaos of family life. I love order and calm (which is next to impossible with small children and a dopey dog). However, I try to embrace the noise and disorder as I know all too soon this will have passed. I love martial arts (Taekwondo) and was just shy of receiving my black belt once upon a time. I hope to one day get back into the sport I used to love! I also enjoy a bit of Swift playgrounds in my spare time or playing with my children on the Switch.</p>
        <p>I am starting my career path anew before my youngest child starts school. I have a background in health and tourism that I hope will add a depth of scope to my career path through IT.</p>

        <h2>Why IT?</h2>
        <p>It is an ever evolving and multifaceted career path. There is not industry at this point that doesnâ€™t involve IT in some form. My love of IT began when I was a small child playing on my grandparents first generation Macintosh computer. The black screen with green text and the old hard disks that were as big as my head inserted into the machine so that I could play the games I loved. Skip forward to school and there were labs of desktop computers. Classes had to put their name down to use the labs for 30 min intervals. All my work was stored on floppy disk before being unceremoniously thrown into my IT binder. If I am honest, I hated IT in my school years. My teacher was horrible and made us copy continuous lines in order to learn touch typing and this was the extent of her lessons.</p>
        <p>Then came the mobile phone. And after that the evolution of that device that has led us to the powerhouse that is the smartphone. An item we take for granted, that we carry in our pocket. I have seen the evolution of this hardware over my lifetime, and it is incredible!</p>
        <p>And then there has been the development is software with the invention of Apps. These are another limitless possibility. If there is a need there is a possibility for a solution. Apps to keep us connected in a pandemic. Apps to keep us on task or teach us new things or just keep us entertained.</p>
        <p>The applications of IT are limitless.</p>

        <h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
        <p>I came to RMIT through open universities. Studying online is my opportunity to develop new skills in an evolving sector of the workforce. My goal with this degree is to upskill so that I am able to be employed doing something I am passionate about and that will positively impact other peoples lives.</p>
