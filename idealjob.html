        <h3>What is the Position</h3>
        <p>The position available with One Network is to work as part of a committed and energetic team designing and developing software for in-house booking platforms and customer platforms for their client (an ASX listed international company selling holiday experiences). As a part of a team who strives for growth and development of their individual skills and those of their brand, I would not only be fulfilling a role as a part of a software design team but further grow my skills in the area of software design. (2021, Seek)</p>

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>I have the personal attributes that One Network are looking for. I have a positive attitude, excellent planning, communication and problem-solving skills.  I am expert at prioritising tasks and staying on schedule and I have experience working with sensitive documents and I am comfortable working both independently and as a member of a team. I am organised and outcome driven and a quick learner who is keen to keep learning over the course of my career.</p>

        <h3>Skills I Need</h3>
        <p>What I lack currently is experience as a software developer, using Ruby on Rails, API development skills, database and JavaScript and an in-depth knowledge of other web fundamentals such as Webpack, HTML and CSS. I will also need to develop my skills relating to front-end (CSS) frameworks and master Git. This is all possible for me to do over time while I study this course and others through my degree at RMIT. </P>
        <p>With my previous experience in hospitality and tourism and my continued development of my skills in IT (specifically in coding, HTML/CSS, database and web fundamentals both front and backend) I would be an ideal fit for the position in the future. </p>
