      <section>

        <h2>Myers-Briggs</h2>
        <h3>Advocate</h3>
        <p>According to Myers-Briggs I fall into the Advocate personality type.  (2021, 16 Personalities) Interestingly after reading the profile I see why they have classed me as such. I would call myself a team player, not thinking myself more important that any other within the group and therefore I feel I act as a peace keeper in situations where conflict may occur. I enjoy working in teams where cooperation and independence are equally valuable. I think my personality type will work well when forming a team with others. I know one of my biggest weakness is my sensitivity to criticism and my perfectionism which often does lead to burnout because I will always try to go the extra mile. This may not mesh well with the values of my team members and will be aspects of myself I will have to work with.</p>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Creative</li>
          <li>Insightful</li>
          <li>Principled</li>
          <li>Passionate</li>
          <li>Altruistic</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sensitive to Criticism</li>
          <li>Reluctant to Open Up</li>
          <li>Perfectionistic</li>
          <li>Avoiding the Ordinary</li>
          <li>Prone to Burnout</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My learning Style according to Education Planner:</h2>
        <h3>Auditory/Tactile learner (2021, Education Planner)</h3>
        <p>As an auditory and tactile learner I lean by hearing and then doing. This works well for me in class situations when I write notes while listening to lectures and then taking time to do the task myself, however I do need to take regular breaks while I study. As a member of a team I feel that listening to the ideas and needs of others and implementing them will lead to the best outcomes for all.</p>

        <h2>Testcolor</h2>
        <h3>Extroverted, Introvert (2021, Testcolor)</h3>
        <p>My personality qualities according to Testcolor indicate that I am creative, imaginative, attuned to the emotions and needs of others and that I communicate my knowledge well to others. I think these attributes work well for me when working as a member of a team. My results also indicate that I set myself goals and that I action plans to achieve them. I hope these attributes of my personality will blend well with my group to reach our combined academic goals.</p>
